# Clustering Project

## Overview
This project implements clustering techniques to analyze and group data points based on their similarities. It uses Python and popular data science libraries to achieve efficient clustering and visualization of results. The notebook named `Clustering.ipynb` is the main entry point of the project.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, normalization, and feature scaling.
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Implements algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering.
- **Visualization**: Provides 2D/3D plots to illustrate clustering results.
- **Metrics**: Evaluates clustering quality using metrics like Silhouette Score.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/DDev30/Clustering.git>
   cd clustering_project
   ```

2. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Clustering.ipynb
   ```

3. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, apply clustering algorithms, and visualize the results.

## Project Structure
- `Clustering.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the implementation and analysis.
- `data/`: Directory to store input datasets.
- `results/`: Directory for saving output plots and results.

## How It Works
1. **Load Data**: Import datasets for clustering.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data for analysis.
3. **Clustering**: Apply selected algorithms and generate clusters.
4. **Evaluation**: Measure the performance of the clustering process.
5. **Visualization**: Present clusters graphically for better insights.

## Example
After running the notebook, you will see:
- Scatter plots showing clusters.
- Performance metrics for evaluating the chosen clustering method.
